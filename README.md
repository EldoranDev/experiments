# Experiments

Small Programming Experiments in different languages that do not justify being put into their own repository.

Most of these projects are very small and are there to compare different topics in different languages.


## Projects

### Go

* [Particle System](https://github.com/EldoranDev/experiments/tree/main/go/particles)
* [TCP Server](https://github.com/EldoranDev/experiments/tree/main/go/tcp-server)
* [TCP Client](https://github.com/EldoranDev/experiments/tree/main/go/tcp-client)

### TypeScript

* [TCP Client](https://github.com/EldoranDev/experiments/tree/main/ts/tcp-client)


## Notes

The TCP Projects should be compatible wiht each other, and each server should be able to read data from every client and vise versa.
